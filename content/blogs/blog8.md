![amandaimage](amandaH.jpg#honor-image)Amanda Hymansmith: Matron of Honor. 'AmandaH' has been my bosom friend since college. (If that sounds unfamiliar to you, just pause here and re-read Anne of Green Gables.) She's inspired so much about the way I try to live by my values, and she's been there for me through most of the formative experiences of my adulthood. In fact, just two months after Casey and I started dating, I arranged for us to visit her and her wonderful partner, Matt, in Portland to get her opinion. Obviously, she approved! ;)

![ckimage](CK.jpg#honor-image)C.K. Miller: Bridesmaid and Tommasina's one and only sister. C.K. has shown me who I am at my meanest and challenged me to be my kindest self. She has undoubtedly shaped me in the way only sisters can. She is brilliant and hilarious, and I love listening to her prove a point when it's not to me. Even though the last time she and my besties, the Amandas, were together, C.K. performed a really raunchy stand-up act that I could still blush at the memory of, I'm really thrilled to have her by my side, adding some of that 'younger sister' edge to my life.

![amandarimage](amandaR.jpg#honor-image) Amanda Rudderman: Bridesmaid. 'AmandaR' is my other best friend named Amanda from college. She's taught me a lot about relationships and family, and she's listened to me sob about more than one heartbreak. (She has the patience of a social worker, because she is a social worker.) I love her honesty and compassion, sense of humor, and her dance moves. We are birds of a feather.
