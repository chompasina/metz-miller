We are so excited that you're going to make it to our special day! We truly can't wait to see you.

If you're interested in giving us even more than your presence at our wedding, we are so touched and hope you don't mind this little explanation of the way we're registering for gifts. Our preference is to both reduce our impact on the earth and to participate in the 'slow' economy by finding old (as opposed to _new_) things that bring value into our lives.

Since this is a non-traditional registry without an anonymous way to mark gifts as purchased, Tommasina's mother, Sue, has offered to help keep track of items on this list for us. Please feel free to send an email to flsuemiller@gmail.com with whatever item you've picked for us, and she'll let us know to mark it as received on the list. We really appreciate your love and care, and we hope you don't mind our presumption in creating this list!
