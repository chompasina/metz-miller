Welcome, our dear friends and family! We're thrilled that you will spend our special day with us.

* Our vision: when we decided we wanted to get married, our priorities were celebrating with our friends and family somewhere that is _beautiful_, _wild_, and _personally meaningful_ to us. We thought about beaches near Tommasina's family in Florida, the mountains we've climbed together, or the botanical gardens where we've whiled away city afternoons in Denver. Ultimately, we realized that the Metz family farm represented the sort of generational continuity and conservation of wild lands that initially drew Tommasina to Casey, not to mention that the farm has a beautiful historic barn with room to gather and dance. Since we are planning to move to Wisconsin this summer, a wedding seemed like a great time for Tommasina's family and all of our friends--many of whom have never visited the state before--to visit and celebrate our new home and married life together.

* When: September 8, 2018
* Where: Metz family farm (6435 Wiesner Rd, Omro, WI) (AKA [Rusty Buckets Farm](https://www.rustybucketsfarm.com))
* Ceremony: afternoon (exact time TBD)
* Reception: evening (exact time TBD) with an old-time square dance to follow
