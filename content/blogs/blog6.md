Terry Gross: I'm Terry Gross and this is Fresh Air. Joining me today are Tommasina Miller and Casey Metz, who are getting married on September 8, 2018. So I guess my first and most obvious question is, how did you two meet?

[The rest of this interview will be live once NPR sends us the official transcript of our interview with Terry Gross.]

Tommasina Miller: Well, as I recall, it was a warm September night, and I was meeting with friends at a show at Avogadro's Number in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Casey Metz: When I arrived to sit with those same friends at Avo's, Tommasina was up in front of the anarchist bluegrass band dancing by herself. (She loves to dance, you should know.)

Tommasina: When the band had finished, Tommasina saw that a strange handsome man was sitting in her seat and in front of her beer. She excused her reach and took her beer back.

Casey: I was encouraged by this and after introducing myself, asked her if she wanted a ride to the band's after-party at their mutual friend's house. Tommasina had biked so she declined but I wasn't ready to give up. At our friend's, we continued to talk for a few hours (Latin root words and noun declinations was the subject of conversation for a while) but alas, we said good-bye with no plans to meet again. I thought I'd never see her again until I ran into her a few weeks later on the CSU campus. We made plans to see each other at the Sustainability Fair that weekend and left it at that, but then, by an act of God, the Sustainability Fair was cancelled due to the devastating floods of 2013. Casey despaired but life went on.

Terry: That must have been hard for you seeing her walk by you while you were on a date. How did that feel for you?

The next time she saw me, Tommasina was meeting up with friends again at Avo's, for two-for-$5 tempeh burgers and bluegrass jam. She was carrying her two burgers to their table when she saw Casey! Her eyes lit up and she approached him before realizing, he was there on a date! Without saying a word, she continued past him to her friends and tried not to look his way the rest of the night. But Casey had other plans. He quickly wrapped up his OkCupid date and pretended to walk out with her and then turned right back around to go back to Avo's to see if Tommasina was still there. She was, and Casey even danced some to trick Tommasina into thinking that he liked to dance too. It worked though, and then Casey asked for Tommasina's number. She was so excited she put her name in his phone as 'Tommasina What What' which is, ridiculously, still her name in his phone.

Their first date: Casey invited Tommasina to see an old-timey band and then Tommasina suggested afterwards that they go dumpster-diving. Anyways, the band was really good, and Casey and Tommasina really hit it off, and they slow-danced to what is now their song. You'll hear it later... Afterwards they were biking on the bike path towards the dumpsters, but paused to look at the incredible stars that night. The stars were so beautiful, and they were so beautiful, so they ended up talking and star-gazing and never quite made it to the dumpsters.

The rest is history! Highlights include: Tommasina moves to DC; Casey and Tommasina get really good at watching movies on speakerphone together on their own computers at the exact same time by counting down to press play at the exact same second; Casey moves Tommasina and her cats, Ollie and Fiona, back to Colorado; Casey and Tommasina become software engineers; they go on their fifth annual backpacking trip when after they almost died in a snow storm, Tommasina surprises Casey with a proposal, Casey says yes, they celebrate by going to hot springs, and plan to live happily ever after. (You'll get to see that part in person soon.)
