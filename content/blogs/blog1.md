Welcome, our dear friends and family! We're thrilled that you will spend our special day with us.

* Our vision: when we decided we wanted to get married, our priorities were celebrating with our friends and family somewhere that is beautiful, wild, and personally meaningful to us. We thought about beaches near Tommasina's family in Florida, the mountains we've climbed together, or the botanical gardens where we whiled away city afternoons in Denver.


* When: September 8, 2018
* Where: Metz Family Farm in Omro, Wisconsin (AKA [Rusty Buckets Farm](https://www.rustybucketsfarm.com))
